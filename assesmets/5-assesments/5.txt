Creating a complete application as described would involve a substantial amount of code and detail. However, I can provide you with a high-level structure and guide you through an approach to implement this Fruit Store Console application adhering to the specified requirements.

Let's break down the implementation into key components:

### Application Structure:

#### 1. Main Program (`main.py`):
- Controls the flow of the application.
- Provides the main menu and handles user input.

#### 2. Fruit Manager Module (`fruit_manager.py`):
- Manages fruit-related operations (add, view, update).
- Stores and manipulates fruit data.

#### 3. Customer Module (`customer.py`):
- Handles customer interactions and transactions.
- Deals with purchases and orders.

#### 4. Logging Module (`logger.py`):
- Handles logging of transactions and events.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Designing the Menu System:**
    - Implement a menu system using `main.py`.
    - Present options for viewing fruit stock, adding stock, customer interaction, etc.

2. **Fruit Manager Module:**
    - Implement functions to add, view, and update fruit stocks in `fruit_manager.py`.
    - Use file handling to read and store fruit data.

3. **Customer Module:**
    - Implement functions for customer interactions in `customer.py`.
    - Handle purchase transactions and orders.

4. **Logging Transactions:**
    - Create a `logger.py` module to handle logging.
    - Record all transactions and events in log files for auditing purposes.

5. **Validation and Error Handling:**
    - Implement validation checks for user input in various modules.
    - Ensure error handling to prevent unexpected terminations.

6. **Documentation and Clean Code:**
    - Follow PEP 8 guidelines for clean and readable code.
    - Use appropriate variable names, function names, comments, and docstrings for clarity.

7. **Testing and Debugging:**
    - Thoroughly test the application to ensure it performs as expected.
    - Debug any issues and make necessary improvements.

8. **GitHub Repository:**
    - Create a GitHub repository for version control.
    - Upload the project, including all modules, branches, and features as described.

### Sample Code Structure (Basic):

```plaintext
fruit_store/
│
├── main.py
│
├── fruit_manager/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── fruit_manager.py
│   └── fruits_data.csv
│
├── customer/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── customer.py
│
└── logger/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── logger.py
```

This structure is just a starting point. You'll need to develop the specific functionality for each module, implement file handling for data persistence, manage user interactions, handle exceptions, and log transactions as required.

Remember to thoroughly test your application and ensure it meets all the specified requirements before uploading it to GitHub.

Certainly, I can help you structure the outline and provide a sample structure for the Fruit Store Console application in Python.

The project structure can be organized as follows:

### Project Structure:

- **main.py** (Main execution file)
  - Contains the main menu and handling of user input
  - Invokes functions from other modules based on user choices

- **fruit_manager.py** (Module for fruit management)
  - Contains functions related to adding, viewing, and updating fruit stocks
  - Implements data manipulation on fruit stock using dictionaries/lists
  - Handles file handling for logging transactions

- **customer.py** (Module for customer interactions)
  - Contains functions related to customer actions
  - Handles user interaction and validations

- **utils.py** (Utility functions)
  - Contains reusable utility functions used across modules

- **logs/** (Directory to store log files)
  - Stores transaction logs

### Sample Main Structure (main.py):

```python
# Import necessary modules
import fruit_manager
import customer

def display_menu():
    # Display the menu options
    print("Fruit Store Console Application")
    print("1. View Fruit Stock")
    print("2. Add Fruit Stock")
    print("3. Update Fruit Stock")
    print("4. Customer Interaction")
    print("0. Exit")

def main():
    while True:
        display_menu()
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == '1':
            fruit_manager.view_fruit_stock()

        elif choice == '2':
            fruit_manager.add_fruit_stock()

        elif choice == '3':
            fruit_manager.update_fruit_stock()

        elif choice == '4':
            customer.customer_interaction()

        elif choice == '0':
            print("Exiting Fruit Store Console Application. Goodbye!")
            break

        else:
            print("Invalid choice! Please enter a valid option.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This structure outlines a basic framework for the Fruit Store Console application. You can expand each module (`fruit_manager.py`, `customer.py`, `utils.py`) with specific functions and logic as per the requirements, utilizing file handling, data structures, and error handling principles. Additionally, each module will have its own set of functions and corresponding log handling methods as mentioned in the requirements.
