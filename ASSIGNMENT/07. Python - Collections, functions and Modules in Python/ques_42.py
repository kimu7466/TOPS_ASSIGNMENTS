# Q.42  Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python? 

'''
The "zip()" method in Python is used to combine elements from multiple lists or iterables into pairs. It allows you to iterate through these lists simultaneously, processing corresponding elements together or creating pairs of elements based on their positions. This function simplifies working with multiple sets of data by aligning elements from different sources.
