1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing? 

answer:- 

In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), tags and elements are closely related but not exactly the same thing.

A tag is the markup code that defines the beginning and end of an element. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, such as `<tag>` or `</tag>`. They provide instructions to the web browser on how to display the content.

An element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. The content is the information displayed on the web page. For example, `<p>` is the opening tag of a paragraph element, and `</p>` is the closing tag. Everything between these tags forms the paragraph element.

So, while tags are the specific pieces of code used to mark up content in HTML, elements are the actual building blocks that make up the structure of a web page, consisting of both the opening and closing tags along with the content between them.
