Q.6 What is Use case Diagram? Create a use-case on bill payment on paytm.

Certainly! A Use Case Diagram is like a map that shows how users (or actors) interact with a system to achieve specific goals or perform tasks. It focuses on what users can do with the system and helps in understanding the functionalities from a user's perspective.

For example, let's create a simple Use Case Diagram for the bill payment feature on Paytm:

In the diagram:

- Actor: User (the person using the Paytm app).
- Use Cases: Actions or tasks the user can perform:
  - View Bills: User can see the list of bills to pay.
  - Select Bill for Payment: User picks a specific bill to pay.
  - Choose Payment Method: User selects how to pay (like using a credit card, debit card, or Paytm wallet).
  - Make Payment: User confirms the payment.
  - Receive Payment Confirmation: User gets a confirmation after successful payment.

Here's a simple representation:

            User
             |
     +-------|-------+
     |               |
  View Bills  Select Bill
     |         for Payment
     |               |
 Choose Payment    Make Payment
      |              |
      +-----|--------+
            |
 Receive Payment Confirmation

This diagram explains how a user interacts with the Paytm app to pay bills. The user can view bills, select one to pay, choose a payment method, make the payment, and finally receive a confirmation.
