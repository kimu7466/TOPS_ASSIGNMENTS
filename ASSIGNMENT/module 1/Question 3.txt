ans.

SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a systematic process used by software developers to create, maintain, and manage software efficiently. SDLC consists of several distinct phases, each with its own objectives, deliverables, and activities. 

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases:

1. Planning: Identifying what needs to be done, setting goals, defining scope, and creating a project plan.

2. Analysis: Gathering requirements, understanding user needs, and defining the software's functionalities.

3. Design: Creating a blueprint or architecture for the software based on the gathered requirements.

4. Implementation: Writing actual code or programming based on the design specifications.

5. Testing: Checking the software for bugs, errors, and ensuring it meets the defined requirements.

6. Deployment: Releasing the software for use, including installation and configuration.

7. Maintenance: Regularly updating and fixing issues to ensure the software operates smoothly and meets evolving needs.

Each phase has its specific goals and activities, contributing to the overall development and deployment of software products.
