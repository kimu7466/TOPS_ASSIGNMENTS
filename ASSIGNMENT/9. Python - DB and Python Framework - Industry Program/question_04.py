# Q.4:- What is Django URLs? make program to create django urls .

"""
In Django, URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) play a crucial role in mapping incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate view functions that generate the response. The URL configuration is defined in the urls.py file within each Django app.

Here's a simple example to demonstrate how to create Django URLs:

Assuming you have a Django project named "myproject" and an app named "myapp," you would typically have the following structure:


myproject/
|-- myproject/
|   |-- settings.py
|   |-- urls.py
|-- myapp/
|   |-- views.py
|   |-- urls.py
|   |-- ...
|-- manage.py


1. Create a Django App:

   
   python manage.py startapp myapp
   

2. Define Views:

   In myapp/views.py, define a simple view function:

   python
   from django.http import HttpResponse

   def hello(request):
       return HttpResponse("Hello, Django!")
   

3. Create URL Patterns:

   In myapp/urls.py, define the URL patterns for your app:

   python
   from django.urls import path
   from .views import hello

   urlpatterns = [
       path('hello/', hello, name='hello'),
   ]
   

   Here, we are defining a URL pattern that maps the path /hello/ to the hello view function.

4. Include App URLs in Project URLs:

   In myproject/urls.py, include the URL patterns from your app:

   python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import path, include

   urlpatterns = [
       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
       path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),  # Include app-specific URLs
   ]
   

   This includes the URLs from the myapp.urls module under the path /myapp/.

5. Run the Development Server:

   Start the development server:

   
   python manage.py runserver
   

   Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/hello/ in your web browser, and you should see the "Hello, Django!" response.

This example demonstrates a basic setup for handling URLs in a Django project. As your project grows, you may have more complex URL configurations with multiple apps, namespaces, and additional features. The URL patterns are crucial for defining the structure of your web application and routing requests to the appropriate views.
