# Q.51  How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python? 

'''
There are three types of functions in Python:

Built-in functions:
These are functions that are pre-defined in the Python interpreter. Some examples of built-in functions are print(), len(), and abs().

User-defined functions:
These are functions that are defined by the user. User-defined functions can take any number of arguments and can return any type of value.

Lambda functions:
Lambda functions are a type of anonymous function. They are smaller and simpler than user-defined functions and are often used for one-off tasks.
