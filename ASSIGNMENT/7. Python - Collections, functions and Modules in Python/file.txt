1 Having a best friend by Shaikh Subuhi is one of the best friendship moral stories in English.
2 The story is about two friends who were walking through the desert.
3 During the journey, they argued over something, and one friend slapped the other.
4 The one who got slapped was hurt by this gesture of his best friend but did not react.
5 He quietly wrote in the sand, “Today my best friend slapped me.”
6   After some time, they found an oasis and started taking a bath in the lake.
7 Suddenly, the one who had been slapped started drowning.
8 Then his friend came to his rescue and saved him.
9 After he recovered from the drowning, he engraved “Today my best friend saved my life” on a stone.
10 The friend who had slapped earlier and later saved his best friend asked,
11 “After I slapped you, you wrote in the sand, and now, as I saved you, you write on a stone, why?”
12 The other friend replied, “I wrote in on sand because we should not keep the feeling of getting hurt by someone for a long time.
13 But, when someone does something good for us, we must remember it forever like a message engraved on a stone that nothing can erase”.
14 Moral: Remember the good things that happen in life, not the bad memories.
