Q.5 What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?

ans:

In JavaScript, "undefined" and "undeclared" are related concepts but with distinct meanings:

1. Undefined:
   - In JavaScript, 'undefined' is a primitive value that represents the lack of a value or the absence of a value's initialization.
   - If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its value is 'undefined' by default.
   - It's also returned by functions that do not explicitly return a value.

   - For example:
     ***********************************************javascript
     let x;
     console.log(x); // Output: undefined
     ***********************************************

2. Undeclared:
   - An undeclared variable is one that has not been declared within the scope it's being referenced. It doesn't exist within the current lexical scope or any parent scopes.
   - If you try to access an undeclared variable, you'll typically encounter a ReferenceError.
   - For example:
     ***********************************************javascript
     console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
     ***********************************************
   - Here, 'y' is an undeclared variable because it has not been declared anywhere in the code.

In summary, 'undefined' refers to a specific value that indicates the absence of a value's initialization, while "undeclared" refers to a variable that hasn't been declared within the scope it's being referenced.
