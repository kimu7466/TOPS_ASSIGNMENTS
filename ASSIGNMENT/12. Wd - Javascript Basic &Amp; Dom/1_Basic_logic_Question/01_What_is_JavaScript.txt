Q.1 What is JavaScript. How to use it? 

ans:

JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for web development. It allows developers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. JavaScript can manipulate HTML and CSS, handle events, create animations, communicate with servers to fetch or send data without reloading the page (AJAX), and much more.
To use JavaScript, you need to include it in your HTML document using `<script>` tags. Here's a basic example of how to use JavaScript within an HTML document:

*************************html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="demo">Hello, World!</h1>

<script>
    // JavaScript code starts here
    // You can select HTML elements and manipulate them
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello, JavaScript!";
</script>

</body>
</html>
*************************

In this example, JavaScript selects an HTML element with the id "demo" and changes its content to "Hello, JavaScript!".

JavaScript can also be used in external files with a .js extension and linked to HTML documents using the `<script>` tag's `src` attribute. Here's how you can do it:

*************************html file
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="demo">Hello, World!</h1>

<script src="script.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
*************************

In this case, the JavaScript code is stored in a separate file named "script.js", and it will be executed when the HTML document is loaded.
