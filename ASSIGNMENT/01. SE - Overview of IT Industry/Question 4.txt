 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Overview
A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of data flow within a system, illustrating how data is processed, stored, and moved between components.

 Key Components

2. Data Stores: Open-ended rectangles showing where data is stored.
3. Data Flows: Arrows indicating the direction of data movement.
4. External Entities: Rectangles representing entities outside the system interacting with it.
